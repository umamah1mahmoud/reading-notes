## *In this note you'll see a breif definition about Git, its properties, features and more.*

* Git is a version control system. One of the most famous and widespread of its kind for many reasons. It's a free and open source for developers. That been said it means you're open to a huge base for information and data about web development.

* It's a handy tool in staging area which is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit. One thing that sets Git apart from other tools is that it's possible to quickly stage some of your files and commit them without committing all of the other modified files in your working directory or having to list them on the command line during the commit.

* It's a smart tool when dealing with projects and their many sub-projects and branches. As well with edits done on versions by each developer working on the project.
