## 1. Add
## 2. Commit
## 3. Push
Three of those together make what we call the "ACP" cycle. Which presents the process of cloning. Cloning is a very important command using Github. It's used to sync projects between the online cloud on Github and the local device the developer is working on. 

1. Simply put, Add is the step that comes right after typing the comman "clone" in windows terminal. Using add to add repo's from a certain url that's being cloned. To add files we edited by VSC we use the command `Git add .` .

2. Followed by commit. The command we use to tell other developers why the changes we've made has been done. It must be in clear words and descriptive enough. The command for it is `Git commit -m followed by the commit we want to add` .

3. Finally, push is where we upload the changes that's been made to the cloud. In this step you'll be asked to type in your Github username and password. For your security the password will not be shown on the screen while you're typing. And to start with this command just type `Git push origin main` and it will be followed by your username.

* Last tip: To get sure you've had it all done you can check out your repo page in your Github account.
