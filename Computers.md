## **What makes a computer a computer?**
Humans have always tried to solve problems with tools around them or developing them. This is exactly what took us all the way to manipulating information! Simply put a computer works by taking an input, storing it then process it by manipulating it by algorithms and sending it again to storage back and forth until processing is done so it can move to output. How output works? It's dependent on what the computer is designed to do.

## **Binary & Data**
You may have heard that computers work by ones and zeros. And you probably seen photos filled with them to state a computing related topic.

| ON  | OFF |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| YES  | NO  |
| TRUE  | FALSE  |
| 1  | 0  |

You might be wondering now, what is it with this table?

Well, this little table describes the state of on/off of a single wire. And it's called a **Bit**. Which is the smallest piece of info a computer can store.

## **The Binary Number System**
Binary is basically the system we link in our minds with those many ones and zeros images. It is another way to represent numbers. The usual one we deal with in basic mathematics is "Decimal".

But, we have many other types of data so how does binary system still deal with it? for example images, images are basically pixels. Each pixel has a specific color. And yes you guessed right each color has a unique number!

## **Circuits and Logic**

Very basic and small circuits that most of us know by now are things like: (Not, And, Nand, Nor, Or, Xor). connecting them makes more complicated circuits.

A circuit that adds two bits together is called an **"Adder"** .  And of course you can put multiple of them together side-by-side.

In the past circuits could be as big as a fridge! And clearly, they took more time to perform. Now adays they are microscobic, and that helps getting them faster cause the smallest it is the less distance it has to go.

## **CPU, Memory, Input & Output**

Input for a starter can be a keyboard, camera, microphone, any kind of sensor including touching screens and more. While Output can be done by screens, 3D printers, speakers, any type of physical motion and much more.

We will now set an example, a simple one to see how it all works:

1. Typing "B" by keyboard, the keyboard converts it to a number that's sent as binary ones and zeros into the computer.
2. Starting from this number, the cpu calculates how to display "B" pixel by pixel.
3. The cpu requests step-by-step instructions from memory, which tells it how to draw "B".
4. The cpu runs these instructions and stores the results as pixels in the memory.
5. FINALLY! The pixel information is sent in binary -again- to the screen. The screen is an output device which converts binary signals into the tiny lights and colors that make up what you see!

Now, isn't that just amazing!

## **Hardware and Software**
Hardware is known as circuits, chips, wires, plugs and more stuff. Software is a part we cannot physically interact with. It's computer programs and codes such as apps, games, web pages..

So how are they put together and interact?

Of course! The cpu. With circuits to send and recieve information from different parts of the computer.

I sincerely wish this came handy to give you better understanding for what a computer is.
