# **[Introducing CSS]**
### **CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets** is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. A topic we already discussed in another note.

_**CSS**_ allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

_**Once**_ you have learned how to write a CSS rule, learning CSS
mostly involves learning the different properties you can use.

_**There**_ are some rules one must follow to make the right commands to apply the wanted styling options. Using different styling methods.

_**CSS**_ works by associating rules with HTML elements. As we mentioned in the sub heading. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

_**One**_ can either use internal or external CSS. The priority goes to internal. However, external can be more flexible and easier to apply on larger scales. It helps in deviding HTML codes from styling codes in CSS.



# **[Color]**

_**Colors**_ are very important part of the whole web pages development process. It can bring pages to life by modifying each part or page of the project. The whole designing is a visual presentation. That been said we can see how important a color role can be.

_**So,**_ how exactly do we specify colors for specific parts? There are three ways to specify any color in CSS:

1. RGB Values
2. HEX Codes
3. Colors names 

Examples for three of them as been mentioned:

1. rgb(102,205,170)
2. #66cdaa
3. MediumAquaMarine

Three of those are different ways to describe the exact same color!

_**Now**_ It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
