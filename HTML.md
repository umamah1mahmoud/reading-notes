![html example](https://www.ultraedit.com/assets/images/lp/html/html-tag.gif)

### Anyone of us who has ever used any website must've encountered this term "HTML" one way or another. So, what does it exactly do? How does it play a role in web development and design?

_**So,**_ you're aware now that we will be discussesing a process that
you can use when you are creating a new website. Starting with HTML.

_**First**_ of all, it's very important to know your target audience. Either as individuals or organizations and companies. Depending on who they are your web design shall be oriented.

This helps you in knowing what your audience need to find in your website. And what should you offer to them. By finding out what they want to achieve by visiting your website.

_**After**_ getting that main part figured out. You can now steadily move to organizing the data and information into sections, lists or pages.

For example you can start by branching your website starting by home, then the main sections with their side branches.

_**Next**_ step! it's the fun sketching part now. We all love doodling around. You can do this step in ANY sketching way starting with windows paint all the way to adobe apps and more.

This shall point out the main layout of your home page.

_**You**_ can then move to creating the vidual design of your pages, controling colors, sizes and all sort of styling options.

# Extra Markup
_**Each**_ new version of **HTML** was designed to be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added and older code removed). For example HTML4 released in 1997, followed by XHTML 1.0 released in the year 2000. It was decided that HTML 4 should be reformulated to follow the rules of XML and it was renamed XHTML. This meant that authors had to follow some new, more strict rules about writing markup. 

# HTML5 Layout
_**As**_ with all HTML5 and CSS3 content, its usage is still subject to change but it is already widely being used by web developers and it is likely that you will want to use them.

_**HTML5**_ introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

_**Many**_ tags can be used in HTML5 for making the page structure and styling it.
