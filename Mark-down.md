# ***MARKDOWN***
### You must've heard a lot about this term if you had any interest about coding or has done any little search. So what exactly is markdown?
* According to GitHub website which is derived for the famous version control system Git, *"Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform."*
So, basically it's a plain text formatting syntax in a more web-development friendly environment. And a software tool, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. It can be considered as a way to communicate between developers.

* Working on markdown might get you confused at first as you've just been introduced to the environment. But what can be a great deal of help with this, is that GitHub offers many sources that will help you around as articles or videos. Besides the large base of developers around the world working with Git, GitHub and markdown. 

* As soon as you start to get the handle of it you'll enjoy it a lot. GitHub offers many styling tools such as themes or text styling preferences. In addition to privacy preferances for each project, either private or sharing it with specific people or keeping it as a public open resource. And of course we cannot but mention the very helpful history saving tools that any developer or designer knows so well how handy can it be. Endless edits may occur to each project or as called on GitHub a "repo". And sometimes even by multiple developers. GitHub history settings help in recording all the edits done by each person.
Keeping the project updated and backed up obviously comes very handy in accessing projects from any place. And preventing any risk of data loss.

`All that said and much more can make markdown used with Git and GitHub, the best tool for web development.`
