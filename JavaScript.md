_**So,**_ we've mentioned in earlier notes **HTML** and **CSS**. After we've known their crucial roles well enough, we can realize that how crucial they are they still actually not enough! websites pages and apps  all around us work in a more advanced and smart way. So, what is the "mentality" behind it? here is your answer: It's **JavaScript**.

_**Just**_ as HTML and CSS, JavaScript is written in plain text.You can edit it in a code editor, the one I am using as most developers is Visual Studio Code. JavaScript is a language that is **case sensitive**. There's a reason I'm writing it bold, because it's very important. Case sensitive means its commands are strict for typos and won't run properly if you had any, so you must watch that carefully.

## **[ JavaScript and HTML]**
_**It's**_ important to know that JavaScript runs where it is found in the HTML. Otherwise it will not be applied correctly.

# **[Data Types]**
_**There**_ are three types of data in JS:
- Numeric data type (4,7,1).
- String data type (that is any character you can see on your keyboard put between quotation marks as, "Student" "6" "!").
- Boolean data type (It can only have one off two values, true or false).
