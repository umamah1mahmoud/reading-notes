In the previous photo types of operators. We will talk now about **logical operators**. 

Comparison operators usually return single values of **true** or **false**. **Logical operators** allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

* Some of the most importantLogical operators are:

## Loops
After understanding operators and their main functions. We will now move to loops so, what is a loop? We are familiar with this term in our daily life. For example when you like a song on YouTube you put it on loop to keep repeating it. It is the same basic concept here but of course in more detailful way.

So the question should be in more precise sense, what is a JavaScript loop? Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be chicked again, and so on until the condition returns false.

There are three common types of loops:
1. For loop, with the following syntax:

2. While loop, with the following syntax:
![while](https://cdn.javascripttutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/JavaScript-while-loop.png)

3. Do-while loop, with the following syntax:
