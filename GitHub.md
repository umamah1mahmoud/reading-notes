## After being introduced to Git as a version control system. It's necessary to get with it a little farther and know more about GitHub.

* It's mainly an internet hosting for software development and version control using Git.

* GitHub is a code editor that is built for collaboration. It allows you to create an account, manage an organization, create and push to repositories, contribute to other peopleâ€™s projects and accept contributions from others. So it's an interactive online environment.

* It can be used as a backup cloud as well. As it allows you to open your projects from any place or any device. It can be pretty helpful with preventing data loss that a hardware damage may cause.

* You can find more very handy information, cheat sheets, resources and much more on **[GitHub.com](https://github.com/)**. Where you can start with making your own portfolio and get going with a journey full of knowledge and challenges.

* I hope this was so briefly helpful for you as it was for me.
