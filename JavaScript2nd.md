## **Introduction**
### What can we do with JavaScript?
1. **Access content.** You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
2. **Modify Content.** You can use JavaScript to add or remove elements , attribute, or text to the page.
3. **Program Rules.** You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow.
4. **React to Events.** You can specify that a script should run when a specific even has occured.

## **Expressions and Operations**
There are two types of expressions; expressions that just assign a value to variable and expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.

Expressions rely on things called operators. Which allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. For example assignmant operators and string operators.
## **Functions**
### What is a function?
Simply put, functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. So it saves you from repeating a needed task over and over.
